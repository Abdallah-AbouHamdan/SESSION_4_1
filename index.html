            <h3>it’s easy to forget that we’re part of nature. We live in an insulated home and wake up with the blinds down. We get ready for the day with a dozen products that come out of tubes and boxes. We breathe fresh air for less than a minute on our way from the door to the car, and again on our way from the car into the office.

                So much of our existence is about shielding us from the natural world. Still, we’re organisms on this green Earth. We’re creatures who feed off its bounties. We’re humbled by its power with every storm. Our very existence is based on Mother Nature’s whims.
                
                Countless nature quotes have gone down in the history books as we try to understand nature and our place in it. History’s great thinkers, leaders, artists, and personalities have each had a different spin on the subject, and the resulting treasure of nature quotes is now yours to peruse.</h3>
